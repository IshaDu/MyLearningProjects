# MyLearningProjects
My small projects to learn different technologies.

Follwoing are different projects those I have done till now.

1) Spring
  About the folder: 
    This folder contains the files of my first spring project. I have created the project in Eclipse and have used the Tomcat 10 server. To see the project working files need to be copied into the Eclipse in the required project structure.
  About the Project:
    This is the project to calculate the Fuel cost of the Road Trip.
    
2) Swing
  About the folder:
    This contains a java file. It needs to be copied into the Eclipse to see the working.
  About the Project:
    THis is a project to calculate the Fuel cost of the Road Trip similar as the above one. But it just has one file which provides user interface and calculates fuel cost to understand the swing components.
